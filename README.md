# Overview
This is a project for my CS 4620 Intelligent Systems class.  The framework has been provided by the professor and each student is responsible for developing our own intelligent poker agent. This style of poker is structured limit Texas Hold'em.

## My Poker Agent
My code is src/edu/poker/elliott/Elliott.java (any other files whose name begins with Elliott are helper files in some way).

## Stages
There are five incremental versions of the poker agent throughout the semester. Versions will be tagged when submitted.  

The stages are:

1. Simple rules agent
2. Advanced rules agent
3. Genetic Algorithms approach
4. Statistical agent
5. Advanced technique with learning
